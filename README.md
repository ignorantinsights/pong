# pong

This is part of the [20 game challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/) as my first entry. Posting more as version control.


The project uses pygame as the game framework. My decision to use pygame came purely out of simplicity and accessibility of use. It was between this, monogame, and SFML. Some of the things done in this pong game are not done through the most efficient means as it is being built in a way so that pieces can be reused in later projects of the 20 game challenge like the reuse of the ball and paddle from pong in breakout for example. There is also an intention of experimentation.


Once this project is completed in pygame my goal will be to translate each game into one of the other frameworks described. The goal here is to use pygame to learn the basics of making simple 2d games, then once I have this knowledge move on to working with a framework like monogame that is more functional.

I do not expect any human to read this but if anyone does then, well, welcome!

Anyways did you hear about the bakery that burnt down? Their business is toast now.
